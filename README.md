## Ideas

### Momentum Based Portfolio:

- High Momentum Stock Focus: We focus on high-quality, high momentum stocks that are more likely to generate higher returns.

- Selection Process: We select 10 standout stocks from the top 500 companies based on a comprehensive evaluation of the company's fundamentals, industry position, and growth potential.

- Use of AI Technology: AI and machine learning algorithms help us identify market trends, anticipate market shifts, and adjust our portfolio strategy.

- Risk Optimization: We balance the potential for high returns with the associated risks, using sophisticated risk management strategies and techniques.

- Diversification: Even though our portfolio is concentrated, we practice diversification among our chosen 10 stocks to spread the risk - Portfolio remains well-rounded and not overly reliant on any single stock or sector.

- Systematic De-Allocation: In high-risk market scenarios, we systematically de-allocate our investments to mitigate risk exposure.
