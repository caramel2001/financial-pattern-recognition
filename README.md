### Analysis on the Next trading day of the Stock that realeased their earnings or any fillings post market or pre market

- Track 10K,10Q,8K etc

   - 10Q -  A quarterly report that includes unaudited financial statements for a company. It's filed three times a year, and is useful for stakeholders who want to - see a company's short-term changes. 
   - Annual report - A report that contains financial data, charts, illustrations, photos, and a letter from the CEO. It's geared toward shareholders.

   - Form 144 - is a document filed with the SEC by someone who intends to sell restricted or control securities, such as when an affiliate sells shares.  Valid for 90 days, and can help predict future sales. Form 144 must be filed if the investor plans to sell more than 5,000 shares or $50,000 of total stock within a three-month period.
   - Form 4 - Insiders, or those related to insiders, must file Form 4 when they actually sell the restricted stock. Form 4 is filed within two business days of the transaction. 

- Perform Intraday time series analysis on the next trading day. The assumption is the stocks which show rapid change in the market sentiments due to the reuslts from the fillings might showcase similar patterns of trading. Check whether there is any significant implications of the Report to volatility of stock price post the report release and also is there any difference based on the market sentiment of the stock.

### Michael Burry's Value Stocks Screener:

To develop a stock-picking strategy based on Michael Burry's approach outlined in the write-up, you can break it down into actionable steps:

#### 1. **Understand the Investment Philosophy**
   - **Value Investing Focus:** Base stock picking on the principle of value investing, ensuring a "margin of safety" to protect against permanent capital loss.
   - **Focus on Out-of-Favor Stocks:** Look for stocks that are currently unpopular or ignored by the market but have potential for recovery.

#### 2. **Screen for Potential Investments**
   - **Use Stock Screeners:** Utilize tools like MSN MoneyCentral's Stock Screener or other screening platforms.
   - **Criteria for Screening:**
     - **Enterprise Value/EBITDA Ratio:** Focus on companies with low enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratios, but allow flexibility based on industry and economic cycle.
     - **Free Cash Flow:** Focus on companies with strong free cash flow (cash generated after operational expenses).
     - **Debt Levels:** Look for companies with minimal debt to avoid financial risk.
   - **Ignore Price-Earnings Ratios (P/E):** Burry deems P/E ratios as less meaningful.
   - **Avoid ROE (Return on Equity):** Be cautious with ROE, as it may be deceptive due to leverage.

#### 3. **Deep Dive Research**
   - **Analyze Enterprise Value:** Calculate enterprise value (EV) as market capitalization + debt - cash to assess the company's total valuation.
   - **Adjust for Off-Balance-Sheet Items:** Account for potential liabilities or assets that aren't immediately apparent on the company's balance sheet.
   - **Focus on True Free Cash Flow:** Evaluate the true free cash flow of the company to understand its capacity to generate cash.

#### 4. **Evaluate the Industry and Economic Cycle**
   - **Look at Industry Trends:** Seek out-of-favor industries with stocks that have been "thrown out with the bathwater."
   - **Best of Breed:** Focus on high-quality companies within struggling industries that may be significantly undervalued.

#### 5. **Calculate Margin of Safety**
   - **Determine Intrinsic Value:** Use your research to establish a realistic, adjusted book value and intrinsic value of the company.
   - **Buy at a Discount:** Purchase the stock only when thereâ€™s a sufficient discount (margin of safety) to protect against downside risk.

#### 6. **Portfolio Management**
   - **Diversify Across Cap Sizes and Sectors:** No restrictions on cap size (large, mid, small), sector (tech or non-tech), or industry, but only invest if clear value is identified.
   - **Ignore General Market Trends:** Don't worry about the overall level of the market; focus purely on the value of individual stocks.
   - **Watch for Catalysts (Optional):** Specific catalysts for price movement arenâ€™t necessary, but they can provide additional comfort for potential upside.

#### 7. **Execute and Monitor the Strategy**
   - **Regularly Screen and Evaluate:** Continually use stock screening tools and fundamental analysis to discover new opportunities.
   - **Reassess Investment Thesis:** Reevaluate positions periodically to ensure they still offer value and have potential for recovery.

By following these steps, you can replicate the fundamental value-investing strategy Michael Burry uses, with a focus on free cash flow, enterprise value, and an industry-agnostic approach.
